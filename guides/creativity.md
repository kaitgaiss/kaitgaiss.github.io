# On creative work

## Be an interested person.
- Don’t be afraid to make mistakes, or waste your time. Do a ton of worthless testing. Do things just for the sake of learning them, even if they don’t ultimately take you anywhere. The most important thing is to stay engaged and excited by the creative process. (is this actually the most important thing?). Don’t be overly hard on yourself in the early stages of a project.
- Don’t let your fear control you. Don’t stop yourself. 
- Enjoy your work. Stay as light and unburdened as possible. Taking yourself too seriously starts to close you up. The results of your work don’t have much to do with you. You can only be in charge of producing the work yourself. 
- The essential ingredients for creativity remain exactly the same for everyone: courage, enchantment, permission, persistence, and trust. 
- Living a life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than fear. 
- A creative life is an amplified life. It’s a bigger life, a happier life, an expanded life, and a hell of a lot more interesting life. Living in this manner — continually and stubbornly bringing forth the jewels that are hidden within you — is a fine art, in and of itself. 
- I decided that I would need to build an expansive enough interior life that my fear and my creativity could peacefully coexist. I make all that space for fear. It seems to me that the less I fight my fear, the less it fights back. If I can relax, fear relaxes too. 
- ENJOY IT. Work had to be enjoyable on a daily basis.
- Treat work as play. Live a rich and rounded life. 
- The art comes from a creative imagination which is working hard and having fun.
- I have many interests, but only a few that are deep enough to power novels. These deep interests (I won’t quite call them obsessions) include how difficult it is—perhaps impossible!—to close Pandora’s technobox once it’s open. 
- the question of why, if there is a God, such terrible things happen
- the thin line between reality and fantasy
- the terrible attraction violence sometimes has for fundamentally good people (The Shining, The Dark Half).
- I’ve also written again and again about the fundamental differences between children and adults, and about the healing power of the human imagination. 
- Writing did not save my life—Dr. David Brown’s skill and my wife’s loving care did that—but it has continued to do what it always has done: it makes my life a brighter and more pleasant place.
- Although it’s never seemed like a choice to me, I live for this feeling. Curiosity is what gets me so involved in something that I forget myself.
- Through attention and curiosity, we can suspend our tendency toward instrumental understanding—seeing things or people one-dimensionally as the products of their functions—and instead sit with the unfathomable fact of their existence, which opens up toward us but can never be fully grasped or known.
- In contrast to I-it, I-Thou recognizes the irreducibility and absolute equality of the other. In this configuration, I meet you “thou” in your fullness by giving you my total attention; because I neither project nor “interpret” you, the world contracts into a moment of a magical exclusivity between you and me.
- I’m reminded of the way Thoreau described unthinking people in “Civil Disobedience”: as basically dead before their time. If I think I know everything that I want and like, and I also think I know where and how I’ll find it—imagining all of this stretching endlessly into the future without any threats to my identity or the bounds of what I call my self—I would argue that I no longer have a reason to keep living.
- we are also running the risk of never being surprised, challenged, or changed—never seeing anything outside of ourselves, including our own privilege. And we’re less prone to the encounters with those who turn us upside down and reorganize our universe—those who stand to change us significantly, should we allow it.


## Paying attention.
- Listening. Being present. Paying attention to people, things.
- Consider where a life of sustained attention leads.
- People can find ways of connecting that are substantive, sustaining
- Attention is contagious
- Art culture as a way of opening up new pathways for attention
- Looking as a positive act; there was “a lot to see” only if you were willing and able to see it. (Hockney)
- All of the artworks I’ve described so far could be thought of as training apparatuses for attention. By inviting us to perceive at different scales and tempos than we’re used to, they teach us not only how to sustain attention but how to move it back and forth between different registers. As always, this is enjoyable in and of itself. But if we allow that what we see forms the basis of how we can act, then the importance of directing our attention becomes all too clear.
- To me, the only habit worth “designing for” is the habit of questioning one’s habitual ways of seeing, and that is what artists, writers, and musicians help us to do.
- My dad, a musician for much of his life, says that this is actually the definition of good music: music that “sneaks up on you” and changes you. And if we’re able to leave room for the encounters that will change us in ways we can’t yet see, we can also acknowledge that we are each a confluence of forces that exceed our own understanding.
- Surprised, challenged, changed. And we’re less prone to the encounters with those who turn us upside down and reorganize our universe—those who stand to change us significantly, should we allow it.
	- ^ Being open and receptive.
- We live in complex times that demand complex thoughts and conversations — and those, in turn, demand the very time and space that is nowhere to be found.
- Consider where a life of sustained attention leads. It leads to awareness, not only of how lucky I am to be alive, but to ongoing patterns of cultural and ecological devastation around me — and the inescapable part that I play in it, should I choose to recognize it or not. Simple awareness is the seed of responsibility.
- One thing I have learned about attention is that certain forms of it are contagious. When you spend enough time with someone who pays close attention to something, you inevitably start to pay attention to some of the same things. 
- I’ve also learned that patterns of attention—what we choose to notice and what we do not— are how we render reality for ourselves, and thus have a direct bearing on what we feel is possible at any given time. 
- So it’s not a problem of getting people to express themselves but of providing little gaps of solitude and silence in which they might eventually find something to say. 
- There is nothing to be admired about being constantly connected, constantly potentially productive the second you open your eyes in the morning—and in my opinion, no one should accept this, not now, not ever.
- IF WE THINK about what it means to “concentrate” or “pay attention” at an individual level, it implies alignment: different parts of the mind and even the body acting in concert and oriented toward the same thing.
- To pay attention to one thing is to resist paying attention to other things; it means constantly denying and thwarting provocations outside the sphere of one’s attention.
- It seems the same is true on a collective level. Just as it takes alignment for someone to concentrate and act with intention, it requires alignment for a “movement” to move. Importantly, this is not a top-down formation, but rather a mutual agreement among individuals who pay intense attention to the same things and to each other.
- Recognize that our attention is being abused. Waking the populace up from a general stupor
- These paintings taught me about attention and duration, and that what I’ll see depends on how I look, and for how long. It’s a lot like breathing. Some kind of attention will always be present, but when we take hold of it, we have the ability to consciously direct, expand, and contract it. I’m often surprised at how shallow both my attention and my breathing are by default.
- As an artist interested in using art to influence and widen attention, I couldn’t help extrapolating the implications from visual attention to attention at large.
- Afterwards, I kept watching for that flutter, like a person with a net in hand waiting for a dragonfly. And I caught it, many times. Maybe this is the beginning of how my own prejudice ends. Watching for it. Catching it and holding it up to the light. Releasing it. Watching for it again.
- attention is a state of openness that assumes there is something new to be seen
- In the short term, distractions can keep us from doing the things we want to do. In the longer term, however, they can accumulate and keep us from living the lives we want to live, or, even worse, undermine our capacities for reflection and self-regulation, making it harder, in the words of Harry Frankfurt, to “want what we want to want.” Thus there are deep ethical implications lurking here for freedom, wellbeing, and even the integrity of the self.
- Most of us have experienced changes in rendering: you notice something once (or someone points it out to you) and then begin noticing it everywhere. As a simplistic example, my attention now “renders” to me a world more full of birds than before I was an avid bird-watcher.
- In that sense, the creek is a reminder that we do not live in a simulation—a streamlined world of products, results, experiences, reviews—but rather on a giant rock whose other life-forms operate according to an ancient, oozing, almost chthonic logic.
- if I don’t make a conscious decision about how to think and what to pay attention to, I’m going to be pissed and miserable every time I have to food-shop, because my natural default-setting is the certainty that situations like this are really all about me, about my hungriness and my fatigue and my desire to just get home, and it’s going to seem, for all the world, like everybody else is just in my way, and who are all these people in my way? But if you’ve really learned how to think, how to pay attention, then you will know you have other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, loud, slow, consumer-hell-type situation as not only meaningful but sacred, on fire with the same force that lit the stars—compassion, love, the sub-surface unity of all things.
- It is with acts of attention that we decide who to hear, who to see, and who in our world has agency. In this way, attention forms the ground not just for love, but for ethics.
- What becomes clear in Barassi’s analysis is that thought and deliberation require not just incubation space (solitude and/or a defined context) but incubation time. My experience suggests that these challenges apply not only to activists but also to an individual trying to communicate with others, or just maintain coherent trains of thought.
- Presented with information in the form of itemized bits and sensationalized headlines—each erased by the arrival of new items at the top of the feed—we lose that which was spatially and temporally adjacent to that information.



## Getting started is everything.
- Take the first practical step.
- You don’t have to know exactly where it is you’re going. You’ll figure that out much better if you get started than if you try to plan it all out. 
- You won’t always know what you’re doing or where you’re going until you get started. 
- Getting something down on paper makes the thing clearer than just thinking about it. It also gives people something to respond to. 
- Once you start, and have physically begun the process, you have something to work from. Your subconscious can work wonders when you have time to mull over what you’ve begun. It provides surprising flashes of inspiration when you’re engaged in other activities.
- Any motion whatsoever beats inertia, because inspiration will always be drawn to motion.
- Establish a goal, define the challenge, and brain dump all of my first notion for a solution. 
- Now kick back and procrastinate. Every part of your life influences how you look at problem solving. Input expands and contracts your mind; sensory changes such as time of day, level of stress, distractions and mood affect your creative thinking positively and negatively. If stuck in a project, take a break, walk outside, talk to a friend — every situation is affecting the project’s outcome, even without you knowing it. 
- Keep a pen handy. Inspiration will smile. When you see the idea again, your mind will be in a new location and pick up where it left off or tell you to start over. This process of idea construction brings together strong creative solutions that hold up over time.
- Give yourself a deadline and stick to it no matter what — that’s the secret ingredient. 
- The scariest moment is always just before you start. After that, things can only get better.

## Immerse yourself.
- Seek inspiration, all the time.
- Inspiration comes from other people, research.
- Let these things breathe new life into your thinking and imagination.
- When you’re inspired, ideas living within us will find a way to be expressed
- Binge. Feed your mind with information, ideas and inspiration related to your subject. Fill your brain. Get it so full of information. Go off on tangents. Follow your interests. And when your head is full, stop. 
- Be mindful of what you consume. When you’re consuming, you’re not creating, and thinking for yourself. That doesn’t mean going cold turkey on any media. It just means being conscious and thoughtful about what you do decide to consume, and making sure you’re giving yourself time and space for your own thinking to simmer and bubble up. 
	- Information today as a kind of assault. Context-less, hitting you in the face, causing whiplash. 
	- By spending too much time on social media and chained to the news cycle, he says, “you are marinating yourself in the conventional wisdom. In other people’s reality: for others, not for yourself. You are creating a cacophony in which it is impossible to hear your own voice, whether it’s yourself you’re thinking about or anything else.”
	- Given the current reality of my digital environment, distance for me usually means things like going on a walk or even a trip, staying off the Internet, or trying not to read the news for a while.
- Bioregionalism teaches us of emergence, interdependence, and the impossibility of absolute boundaries. As physical beings, we are literally open to the world, suffused every second with air from somewhere else; as social beings, we are equally determined by our contexts. If we can embrace that, then we can begin to appreciate our and others’ identities as the emergent and fluid wonders that they are.
- Most of all, we can open ourselves to those new and previously unimaginable ideas that may arise from our combination, like the lightning that happens between an evanescent cloud and the ever-shifting ground.
- It also requires humility and openness, because to seek context is already to acknowledge that you don’t have the whole story. And perhaps most important, an ecological understanding takes time. Context is what appears when you hold your attention open for long enough; the longer you hold it, the more context appears.


## Create space.
- Sit quietly. Listen. Be present. Reduce multitasking because that wears down the brain. Depends on when you’re doing your creative work. Find the time of day that works best for you.
- Traveler’s mindset
- Have a place where you go to be refreshed and receptive. Anything that prepares your mind, body, and spirit for the artistic and creative challenges to come. This is a place you go on a regular basis to enjoy or indulge yourself, let go of worries, where nothing is planned, ideas surface on their own, and you reap the benefits of the frequent time outs you take.
- A place where you can go and just get lost. Lose track of time and space and self.  
- Turn off distractions. You need time and space to do the work. 
- You’re likely consumed by your own dramas, anxieties, distractions, insecurities and duties that you aren’t receptive to inspiration. You might miss the signal because you’re watching TV, or shopping, or brooding over how angry you are at somebody, or pondering your failures and mistakes, or generally just really busy.
- There will come a day when you’re open and relaxed enough to actually receive something. 
- Simple understanding that whatever is bad for you is probably bad for your work. 
- It starts with this: put your desk in the corner, and every time you sit down there to write, remind yourself why it isn’t in the middle of the room. Life isn’t a support-system for art. It’s the other way around.(stephen king)
- The biggest aid to regular (Trollopian?) production is working in a serene atmosphere. It’s difficult for even the most naturally productive writer to work in an environment where alarms and excursions are the rule rather than the exception.
- The combination of a healthy body and a stable relationship with a self-reliant woman who takes zero shit from me or anyone else has made the continuity of my working life possible.
- The space can be humble (probably should be, as I think I have already suggested), and it really needs only one thing: a door which you are willing to shut. The closed door is your way of telling the world and yourself that you mean business; you have made a serious commitment to write and intend to walk the walk as well as talk the talk.
- By the time you step into your new writing space and close the door, you should have settled on a daily writing goal. As with physical exercise, it would be best to set this goal low at first, to avoid discouragement. I suggest a thousand words a day, and because I’m feeling magnanimous, I’ll also suggest that you can take one day a week off, at least to begin with. No more; you’ll lose the urgency and immediacy of your story if you do. With that goal set, resolve to yourself that the door stays closed until that goal is met.
- Whether it’s a vignette of a single page or an epic trilogy like The Lord of the Rings, the work is always accomplished one word at a time. The door closes the rest of the world out; it also serves to close you in and keep you focused on the job at hand.
- it’s wise to eliminate every possible distraction.
- We live in complex times that demand complex thoughts and conversations — and those, in turn, demand the very time and space that is nowhere to be found.
- “trouble” of a troubled mind came from unnecessary mental baggage in the form of runaway desires, ambitions, ego, and fear. What he proposed in their absence was simple: relaxed contemplation in a community that was turned away from the city at large.
- That was fine, since he believed that “the purest security is that which comes from a quiet life and withdrawal from the many.”
- Living outside the city. So much inspiration there, but you also need to be able to retreat. 
- Limit your desires. Non-attachment. This can be at odds in living in an environment with lots of stimulation. 
	- For months he and two friends hid away at a house his parents owned in the Catskills: “The snow fell four feet deep and at evening we would sit and watch the sun turn the sky purple and orange across the frozen lake.”
	- Jia Tolentino writes about this, about the writers retreat. As does Jenny Odell with just going to a cabin in the woods for long writing weekends. 
	- History is full of people seeking remote hermits and sages, desperate for knowledge from a mind unconcerned with familiar comforts.
	- Removal and contemplation were necessary to be able to see what was happening, but that same contemplation would always bring one back around to their responsibility to and in the world.
	- We absolutely require distance and time to be able to see the mechanisms we thoughtlessly submit to. More than that, as I’ve argued thus far, we need distance and time to be functional enough to do or think anything meaningful at all.
	- Explaining his need to live sparely in a cabin away from the customs and comforts of society, Henry David Thoreau famously wrote: I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived…I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion.
- SOLITUDE - one needs to remove herself in order to be able to think critically.
- we will require new kinds of alliances and formations, which will further require periods both of solitude and of intense connection and communication. But how can we do that when our platforms for “connection” and expression detract from the attention to place and time that we need, simultaneously eroding the contexts that would allow new strategies to sharpen and flourish?
- I THINK OFTEN about how much time and energy we use thinking up things to say that would go over well with a context-collapsed crowd—not to mention checking back on how that crowd is responding. This is its own form of “research,” and when I do it, it feels not only pathetic but like a waste of energy.
- The last thing you need is further distraction. Find when you’re in a “scarcity” state of mind. 
- Lose track of time and space and self. For most of history, people just made things, and they didn’t make such a big freaking deal about it. Take you out of yourself.
- Every time you express a complaint about how difficult and tiresome it is to be creative, inspiration takes another step away from you, offended. Start telling yourself that you enjoy your work. We need you to stay as light and unburdened as possible to keep you creating. Because of my deep and lifelong conviction that the results of my work don’t have much to do with me, I can only be in charge of producing the work itself. Taking yourself too seriously starts to close things up. My creative expression must be the most important thing in the world to me (if I am to live artistically), and it also must not matter at all (if I am to live sanely). 

## Show the fuck up.
- My job is to work hard and stay focused. 
- In the end, it’s all about the work, isn’t it?
- Show up for your work day after day after day after day.
- It’s a simple and generous rule of life that whatever you practice, you’ll improve at. Just stay with the process and don’t panic. We’re meant to engage with inspiration, and inspiration wants to work with us. 
- Keep it about the work. Focus on the work itself. Make that the thing. Not how successful you are or if your profile looks good, or whatever else. Focus on what interests you and make it about that. 
- Practice the art, always reminding yourself that your job is to say what you see, and then to get on with your story.
- Keep showing up. Even when you’re not feeling it. 
- If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot. This sort of stylistic blending is a necessary part of developing one’s own style, but it doesn’t occur in a vacuum. You have to read widely, constantly refining (and redefining) your own work as you do so. Reading is the creative center of a writer’s life. I take a book with me everywhere I go, and find there are all sorts of opportunities to dip in. Reading takes time, and the glass teat takes too much of it.
- The sort of strenuous reading and writing program I advocate—four to six hours a day, every day—will not seem strenuous if you really enjoy doing these things and have an aptitude for them; in fact, you may be following such a program already.
- If “read a lot, write a lot” is the Great Commandment—and I assure you that it is—how much writing constitutes a lot?
- he wrote for two and a half hours each morning before leaving for work. This schedule was ironclad. If he was in mid-sentence when the two and a half hours expired, he left that sentence unfinished until the next morning. And if he happened to finish one of his six-hundred-page heavyweights with fifteen minutes of the session remaining, he wrote The End, set the manuscript aside, and began work on the next book.
- My own schedule is pretty clear-cut. Mornings belong to whatever is new—the current composition. Afternoons are for naps and letters. Evenings are for reading, family, Red Sox games on TV, and any revisions that just cannot wait. Basically, mornings are my prime writing time.
- Once I start work on a project, I don’t stop and I don’t slow down unless I absolutely have to. If I don’t write every day, the characters begin to stale off in my mind
- Still, I believe the first draft of a book—even a long one—should take no more than three months, the length of a season. I like to get ten pages a day, which amounts to 2,000 words. That’s 180,000 words over a three-month span, a goodish length for a book—something in which the reader can get happily lost, if the tale is done well and stays fresh.
- If you’re a beginner, though, let me urge that you take your story through at least two drafts; the one you do with the study door closed and the one you do with it open.
- With the door shut, downloading what’s in my head directly to the page, I write as fast as I can and still remain comfortable.
- If I write rapidly, putting down my story exactly as it comes into my mind, only looking back to check the names of my characters and the relevant parts of their back stories, I find that I can keep up with my original enthusiasm and at the same time outrun the self-doubt that’s always waiting to settle in.
- This first draft—the All-Story Draft—should be written with no help (or interference) from anyone else.
- There’ll be time to show off what you’ve done when you finish  . . . . but even after finishing I think you must be cautious and give yourself a chance to think while the story is still like a field of freshly fallen snow, absent of any tracks save your own.
- The great thing about writing with the door shut is that you find yourself forced to concentrate on story to the exclusion of practically everything else.
- getting that first draft down on paper while the shape of the fossil is still bright and clear in your mind.
- Like the Zen approach to archery or anything else, you identify the goal and then forget about it and concentrate on the process.

## Creativity is a muse. Treat it like one.
- Give your creativity a name or something. Make it be a muse if that makes you feel less pressure. You’re trying to make yourself as receptive and open to the muse as possible. Keeping your mind engaged. If you’re in service to this other being this other entity, rather than responsible to yourself, I find it eases the pressure. This outside force wants to work through you, you just need to let it. It’s not about you failing to live up to your own god damn potential. 
- It’s a subtle but important distinction between being a genius, and having a genius. When artists are burdened with the label of “genius” they run the risk of losing the ability to take themselves lightly, or to create freely. Rather than being a genius, the Greeks and Romans both believed in the idea of an external daemon of creativity, a sort of house elf you lived within the walls of your home and aided you in your efforts. The Romans didn’t believe an exceptionally gifted person was a genius, they believed they had a genius.
- Try to present yourself to your creativity as if you are sexy — as if you are somebody worth spending time with. 
- Take you out of yourself. 
- ^^ I am so obsessed with the above and I’ve heard others describe it as such
- Present yourself well. Get dressed to do the work. 
- The work wants to be made, and it wants to be made through you.
- good story ideas seem to come quite literally from nowhere, sailing at you right out of the empty sky: two previously unrelated ideas come together and make something new under the sun. Your job isn’t to find these ideas but to recognize them when they show up.
- These alien creatures got into your head and just started  . . . . well, tommyknocking around in there. What you got was energy and a kind of superficial intelligence (the writer, Bobbi Anderson, creates a telepathic typewriter and an atomic hot-water heater, among other things). What you gave up in exchange was your soul. It was the best metaphor for drugs and alcohol my tired, overstressed mind could come up with.
- At its most basic we are only discussing a learned skill, but do we not agree that sometimes the most basic skills can create things far beyond our expectations? We are talking about tools and carpentry, about words and style  . . . . but as we move along, you’d do well to remember that we are also talking about magic.
- There is a muse, but he’s not going to come fluttering down into your writing room and scatter creative fairy-dust all over your typewriter or computer station. He lives in the ground. He’s a basement guy. You have to descend to his level, and once you get down there you have to furnish an apartment for him to live in. You have to do all the grunt labor, in other words, while the muse sits and smokes cigars and admires his bowling trophies and pretends to ignore you. Do you think this is fair? I think it’s fair. He may not be much to look at, that muse-guy, and he may not be much of a conversationalist (what I get out of mine is mostly surly grunts, unless he’s on duty), but he’s got the inspiration. It’s right that you should do all the work and burn all the midnight oil, because the guy with the cigar and the little wings has got a bag of magic. There’s stuff in there that can change your life.
- Personal note: Playing the role of a paleontologist or archaeologist or a sculptor. Have seen those metaphors get thrown out a lot by both Gilbert and King. 
- I want you to understand that my basic belief about the making of stories is that they pretty much make themselves.
- I believed stories are found things, like fossils…
- Stories are relics, part of an undiscovered pre-existing world. The writer’s job is to use the tools in his or her toolbox to get as much of each one out of the ground intact as possible. Sometimes the fossil you uncover is small; a seashell. Sometimes it’s enormous, a Tyrannosaurus Rex with all those gigantic ribs and grinning teeth.
- No matter how good you are, no matter how much experience you have, it’s probably impossible to get the entire fossil out of the ground without a few breaks and losses. To get even most of it, the shovel must give way to more…
- Plot is a far bigger tool, the writer’s jackhammer. You can liberate a fossil from hard ground with a jackhammer, no argument there, but you know as well as I do that the jackhammer is going to break almost as much stuff as it liberates. It’s clumsy, mechanical, anticreative. Plot is, I think, the good writer’s last resort and the dullard’…
- A strong enough situation renders the whole question of plot moot, which is fine with me. The most interesting situations can usually be expressed as a What-if question:
	- What if vampires invaded a small New England village? (‘Salem’s Lot)
	- What if a policeman in a remote Nevada town went berserk and started killing everyone in sight? (Desperation)
	- What if a cleaning woman suspected of a murder she got away with (her husband) fell under suspicion for a murder she did not commit (her employer)?
	- What if a young mother and her son became trapped in their stalled car by a rabid dog?
	- These were all situations which occurred to me—while showering, while driving, while taking my daily walk—and which I eventually turned into books.
- I think that, when you read your manuscript over (and when you talk it over), you’ll see if symbolism, or the potential for it, exists. If it doesn’t, leave well enough alone. If it does, however—if it’s clearly a part of the fossil you’re working to unearth—go for it.
- Personal note: This idea that I’m just the person uncovering things that already exist (a paleontologist uncovering fossils), than someone coming up with entirely new ideas out of thin air. 
- People are not geniuses. They have geniuses, which is this entirely separate kind of creature or entity that lives within the walls of your home and aids you in your efforts.
- Personal note: you can still set boundaries and guidelines. Like, this is what we think the shape thing is, and here are the qualities we really care about. But keeping the shape large early on, and whittling it down from there, like you’re excavating a dinosaur of creating a sculpture, and being careful to not be overly prescriptive too early in the process. 
- Personal note: It’s not bringing something to life, it’s unearthing it. 
- I read this elsewhere and it’s relevant here, need to find the original quote: It’s a sculptor who knows there is something hidden within the marble, it’s her job to find it and excavate it. 
- Personal note: You’re just uncovering stuff that’s already there. That takes the pressure off it. You just have to be open and paying attention. 


## Take care of yourself.
- Simple understanding that whatever is bad for you is probably bad for your work.

## Take a fucking break.
- When your head is full, stop. Take a break. Fuck around. Don’t do anything related to your project, because this is when the really hardworking part of your brain goes into high gear. Go for a walk or a run. These low cognitive load activities are pretty amazing at creating the space you need for your brain to make connections. Relax, live, absorb.
- Step away to gain a new perspective. 
- Make a list of things that interest or inspire you — seeing movies, visiting museums and art galleries, getting back to nature by going to far hike or gardening, traveling whenever or wherever you can, and reading at every opportunity. Doing unfamiliar things puts you in a learning mode that refills the web quickly.
- If you write a novel, spend weeks and then months catching it word by word, you owe it both to the book and to yourself to lean back (or take a long walk) when you’ve finished and ask yourself why you bothered—why you spent all that time, why it seemed so important. In other words, what’s it all about, Alfie?
- You’ve done a lot of work and you need a period of time (how much or how little depends on the individual writer) to rest. Your mind and imagination—two things which are related, but not really the same—have to recycle themselves, at least in regard to this one particular work. My advice is that you take a couple of days off—go fishing, go kayaking, do a jigsaw puzzle—and then go to work on something else. Something shorter, preferably, and something that’s a complete change of direction and pace from your newly finished book.
- How long you let your book rest—sort of like bread dough between kneadings—is entirely up to you, but I think it should be a minimum of six weeks. During this time your manuscript will be safely shut away in a desk drawer, aging and (one hopes) mellowing.
- You’re not, though, and you’re not ready to go back to the old project until you’ve gotten so involved in a new one (or re-involved in your day-to-day life) that you’ve almost forgotten the unreal estate that took up three hours of your every morning or afternoon for a period of three or five or seven months.
- When you come to the correct evening (which you well may have marked on your office calendar), take your manuscript out of the drawer. If it looks like an alien relic bought at a junk-shop or yard sale where you can hardly remember stopping, you’re ready.
- And it takes a break to remember that: a break to do nothing, to just listen, to remember in the deepest sense what, when, and where we are.
- I consider “doing nothing” both as a kind of deprogramming device and as sustenance for those feeling too disassembled to act meaningfully.
- When overstimulation has become a fact of life, I suggest that we reimagine #FOMO as #NOMO, the necessity of missing out. 


## Share your work.
- Share your stuff and show your work to people around you.
- Making things, sharing those things with an open heart and no expectations.
- Also, needy or not, you might want to watch and see when your I.R. puts your manuscript down to do something else. What scene was he or she reading? What was so easy to put down?
- You need to listen very carefully to the things I.R. didn’t understand, and then ask yourself if you understand them. If you do and just didn’t put those parts across, your job on the second draft is to clarify. If you don’t—if the parts of the back story your Ideal Reader queried are hazy to you, as well—then you need to think a lot more carefully about the past events that cast a light on your characters’ present behavior.
- In the very same essay, he mentions the importance of having a close friend to have real and substantive conversations with.
- The book you are reading—as I would guess is the case with most books—is the result of many conversations I’ve had over the course of many years, in my case with both humans and nonhumans. Many of them happened while I was writing this, and all of them changed my mind. Now, as you read it, this book forms a conversation with you as well.
- Meanwhile, countless examples from history and ecological science teach us that a diverse community with a complex web of interdependencies is not only richer but more resistant to takeover. When I read Schulman’s The Gentrification of the Mind, I picture the difference between a permaculture farm and a commercial corn farm that could be devastated by a single parasite.
	- Personal Note: DIVERSITY OF SOURCES, VOICES, IDEAS THAT YOU CAN BUILD ON AND MERGE WITH OTHER IDEAS INTO SOMETHING NEW
- I don’t bring my phone or any device during the run. I develop ideas locally, and reserve them (stage them, as in github terminology) and share them once I’m ready for more encounters.
- When I try to imagine a sane social network it is a space of appearance: a hybrid of mediated and in-person encounters, of hours-long walks with a friend, of phone conversations, of closed group chats, of town halls.


## Refine.
- For me the answer has always been two drafts and a polish 
- Sit down with your door shut (you’ll be opening it to the world soon enough), a pencil in your hand, and a legal pad by your side. Then read your manuscript over.
- Do it all in one sitting, if that’s possible (it won’t be, of course, if your book is a four- or five-hundred-pager).
- Make all the notes you want, but concentrate on the mundane housekeeping jobs, like fixing misspellings and picking up inconsistencies.
- With six weeks’ worth of recuperation time, you’ll also be able to see any glaring holes in the plot or character development. I’m talking about holes big enough to drive a truck through. It’s amazing how some of these things can elude the writer while he or she is occupied with the daily work of composition. And listen—if you spot a few of these big holes, you are forbidden to feel depressed about them or to beat up on yourself.

## Capture ideas.
- Keep one or multiple types of writing instruments to capture ideas and impulses. Ideas can be fleeting. I have a little notebook, but I also jot things down in my Things apps and file them away in the Someday tab. Organization isn’t super important, the main thing is to get the ideas down.

## Hone your process.
- Building a routine.
- Your schedule—in at about the same time every day, out when your thousand words are on paper or disk—exists in order to habituate yourself, to make yourself ready to dream just as you make yourself ready to sleep by going to bed at roughly the same time each night and following the same ritual as you go.
- In both writing and sleeping, we learn to be physically still at the same time we are encouraging our minds to unlock from the humdrum rational thinking of our daytime lives.
- Your job is to make sure the muse knows where you’re going to be every day from nine ‘til noon or seven ‘til three. If he does know, I assure you that sooner or later he’ll start showing up, chomping his cigar and making his magic.
- There is this cycle. Some hybrid reaction is needed. We have to be able to do both: to contemplate and participate, to leave and always come back, where we are needed.
	- Thoreau’s ultimate hope was that if enough individual people decided at once to exercise their moral judgment instead of continuing to play the game, then the game might actually change for once.
	- This collective alignment emerges as a product of intense individual self-discipline—like a crowd of Thoreaus refusing in tandem. In so doing, the “third space”—not of retreat, but of refusal, boycott, and sabotage—can become a spectacle of noncompliance that registers on the larger scale of the public.
- Just stay with the process and don’t panic. You’re supposed to be there - we are meant to engage with inspiration, and inspiration wants to work with us.

## Curation as a creative act.
- It’s not always about it being super original. You can build on the work and ideas of others if you have something new and fresh to contribute to it
- Combinatory play - the act of opening up one mental channel by dabbling in another. 
- Doing nothing is an antidote to the rhetoric of growth. In the context of health and ecology, things that grow unchecked are often considered parasitic or cancerous. Yet we inhabit a culture that privileges novelty and growth over the cyclical and the regenerative. Our very idea of productivity is premised on the idea of producing something new, whereas we do not tend to see maintenance and care as productive in the same way.

## Ignore everything.

## Scratchpad.
- Really all boils down to inspiration, stimulation, learning, curiosity. 
- Understand the problem, do the research, play hard looking for potential options, sleep on it, and let your subconscious do the rest.
- It’s a virtuous cycle. The more you practice, learn, and make discoveries, the more confident you’ll be. 
- Richer, more textured. More varied. 
- State of uninterrupted marvel 
- I knew, not because Owen stopped practicing, but because he was practicing only during the periods Mr. Bowie had set for him: half an hour after school four days a week, plus an hour on the weekends. Owen mastered the scales and the notes—nothing wrong with his memory, his lungs, or his eye-hand coordination—but we never heard him taking off, surprising himself with something new, blissing himself out. And as soon as his practice time was over, it was back into the case with the horn, and there it stayed until the next lesson or practice-time.
- What this suggested to me was that when it came to the sax and my son, there was never going to be any real play-time; it was all going to be rehearsal. That’s no good. If there’s no joy in it, it’s just no good. It’s best to go on to some other area, where the deposits of talent may be richer and the fun quotient higher. Talent renders the whole idea of rehearsal meaningless; when you find something at which you are talented, you do it (whatever it is) until your fingers bleed or your eyes are ready to fall out of your head. Even when no one is listening (or reading, or watching), every outing is a bravura performance, because you as the creator are happy. Perhaps even ecstatic. That goes for reading and writing as well as for playing a musical instrument, hitting a baseball, or running the four-forty.
- I knew Winifred back in the 1990s, in Greenwich Village. I first met her at her ninetieth birthday party, which was quite a wild bash. She was a friend of a friend of mine (a guy who was in his twenties; Winifred had friends of all ages and backgrounds). Winifred was a bit of a luminary around Washington Square back in the day. She and her late husband (a scientist) had spent their vacations chasing typhoons and hurricanes all over the world, just for fun. She kind of was a hurricane herself. Winifred was the most vividly alive woman I had ever met in my young life, so one day, looking for inspiration, I asked her, “What’s the best book you’ve ever read?” She said, “Oh darling. I could never narrow it down to just one book, because so many books are important to me. But I can tell you my favorite subject. Ten years ago, I began studying the history of ancient Mesopotamia, and it became my passion, and let me tell you — it has totally changed my life."
- If you devote yourself to anything diligently for ten years, you’ll be an expert. 
- If you want to live a contented creative life, you do not want to cultivate either one of those traits (laziness and perfectionism).
- Be satisfied with the smallest progress, and treat the outcome of it all as unimportant. 
- Through the mere act of creating something, anything — you might inadvertently produce work that is magnificent, eternal, or important. 
- If I am not actively creating something, then I am probably actively destroying something (myself, a relationship, or my own piece of mind). 
- We all need something that helps us to forget ourselves for awhile. 
- Nobody was ever thinking of you, anyhow. Go be whoever you want to be then. Do whatever you want to do. Pursue whatever fascinates you and brings you to life.
- Do what you love to do, and do it with both seriousness and lightness.
- What is sacred is the time that you spend working on the project, and what that time does to expand your imagination, and what that expanded imagination does to transform your life.
