# On creative work

## Be an interested person.
- Don’t be afraid to make mistakes, or waste your time. Do a ton of worthless testing. Do things just for the sake of learning them, even if they don’t ultimately take you anywhere. The most important thing is to stay engaged and excited by the creative process. (is this actually the most important thing?). Don’t be overly hard on yourself in the early stages of a project.
- Don’t let your fear control you. Don’t stop yourself. 
- Enjoy your work. Stay as light and unburdened as possible. Taking yourself too seriously starts to close you up. The results of your work don’t have much to do with you. You can only be in charge of producing the work yourself. 
- The essential ingredients for creativity remain exactly the same for everyone: courage, enchantment, permission, persistence, and trust. 


## Paying attention.
- Listening. Being present. Paying attention to people, things.


## Getting started is everything.
- Take the first practical step.
- You don’t have to know exactly where it is you’re going. You’ll figure that out much better if you get started than if you try to plan it all out. 
- You won’t always know what you’re doing or where you’re going until you get started. 
- Getting something down on paper makes the thing clearer than just thinking about it. It also gives people something to respond to. 
- Once you start, and have physically begun the process, you have something to work from. Your subconscious can work wonders when you have time to mull over what you’ve begun. It provides surprising flashes of inspiration when you’re engaged in other activities.
- Any motion whatsoever beats inertia, because inspiration will always be drawn to motion.
- Establish a goal, define the challenge, and brain dump all of my first notion for a solution. 
- Now kick back and procrastinate. Every part of your life influences how you look at problem solving. Input expands and contracts your mind; sensory changes such as time of day, level of stress, distractions and mood affect your creative thinking positively and negatively. If stuck in a project, take a break, walk outside, talk to a friend — every situation is affecting the project’s outcome, even without you knowing it. 
- Keep a pen handy. Inspiration will smile. When you see the idea again, your mind will be in a new location and pick up where it left off or tell you to start over. This process of idea construction brings together strong creative solutions that hold up over time.
- Give yourself a deadline and stick to it no matter what — that’s the secret ingredient. 
- The scariest moment is always just before you start. After that, things can only get better.

## Immerse yourself.
- Seek inspiration, all the time.
- Inspiration comes from other people, research.
- Let these things breathe new life into your thinking and imagination.
- When you’re inspired, ideas living within us will find a way to be expressed
- Binge. Feed your mind with information, ideas and inspiration related to your subject. Fill your brain. Get it so full of information. Go off on tangents. Follow your interests. And when your head is full, stop. 

## Create space.
- Sit quietly. Listen. Be present. Reduce multitasking because that wears down the brain. Depends on when you’re doing your creative work. Find the time of day that works best for you.
- Traveler’s mindset
- Have a place where you go to be refreshed and receptive. Anything that prepares your mind, body, and spirit for the artistic and creative challenges to come. This is a place you go on a regular basis to enjoy or indulge yourself, let go of worries, where nothing is planned, ideas surface on their own, and you reap the benefits of the frequent time outs you take.
- A place where you can go and just get lost. Lose track of time and space and self.  
- Turn off distractions. You need time and space to do the work. 
- You’re likely consumed by your own dramas, anxieties, distractions, insecurities and duties that you aren’t receptive to inspiration. You might miss the signal because you’re watching TV, or shopping, or brooding over how angry you are at somebody, or pondering your failures and mistakes, or generally just really busy.
- There will come a day when you’re open and relaxed enough to actually receive something. 
- Simple understanding that whatever is bad for you is probably bad for your work. 


## Show the fuck up.
- It’s a simple and generous rule of life that whatever you practice, you’ll improve at. Just stay with the process and don’t panic. We’re meant to engage with inspiration, and inspiration wants to work with us. 
- Keep it about the work. Focus on the work itself. Make that the thing. Not how successful you are or if your profile looks good, or whatever else. Focus on what interests you and make it about that. 

## Creativity is a muse. Treat it like one.
- Give your creativity a name or something. Make it be a muse if that makes you feel less pressure. You’re trying to make yourself as receptive and open to the muse as possible. Keeping your mind engaged. If you’re in service to this other being this other entity, rather than responsible to yourself, I find it eases the pressure. This outside force wants to work through you, you just need to let it. It’s not about you failing to live up to your own god damn potential. 
- It’s a subtle but important distinction between being a genius, and having a genius. When artists are burdened with the label of “genius” they run the risk of losing the ability to take themselves lightly, or to create freely. Rather than being a genius, the Greeks and Romans both believed in the idea of an external daemon of creativity, a sort of house elf you lived within the walls of your home and aided you in your efforts. The Romans didn’t believe an exceptionally gifted person was a genius, they believed they had a genius.
- Take you out of yourself. 
- ^^ I am so obsessed with the above and I’ve heard others describe it as such
- Present yourself well. Get dressed to do the work. 
- The work wants to be made, and it wants to be made through you.

## Take care of yourself.

## Take a fucking break.
- When your head is full, stop. Take a break. Fuck around. Don’t do anything related to your project, because this is when the really hardworking part of your brain goes into high gear. Go for a walk or a run. These low cognitive load activities are pretty amazing at creating the space you need for your brain to make connections. Relax, live, absorb.
- Step away to gain a new perspective. 
- Make a list of things that interest or inspire you — seeing movies, visiting museums and art galleries, getting back to nature by going to far hike or gardening, traveling whenever or wherever you can, and reading at every opportunity. Doing unfamiliar things puts you in a learning mode that refills the web quickly.

## Share your work.
- Share your stuff and show your work to people around you.
- Making things, sharing those things with an open heart and no expectations.


## Refine.

## Capture ideas.
- Keep one or multiple types of writing instruments to capture ideas and impulses. Ideas can be fleeting. I have a little notebook, but I also jot things down in my Things apps and file them away in the Someday tab. Organization isn’t super important, the main thing is to get the ideas down.

## Hone your process.
- Building a routine.

## Curation as a creative act.

## Ignore everything.

## Scratchpad.
- Really all boils down to inspiration, stimulation, learning, curiosity. 
- Understand the problem, do the research, play hard looking for potential options, sleep on it, and let your subconscious do the rest.
- It’s a virtuous cycle. The more you practice, learn, and make discoveries, the more confident you’ll be. 
- Richer, more textured. More varied. 
- State of uninterrupted marvel
