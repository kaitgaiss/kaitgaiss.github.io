# On creative work

## Be an interested person.
- Don’t be afraid to make mistakes, or waste your time. Do a ton of worthless testing. Do things just for the sake of learning them, even if they don’t ultimately take you anywhere. The most important thing is to stay engaged and excited by the creative process. (is this actually the most important thing?). Don’t be overly hard on yourself in the early stages of a project.
- Don’t let your fear control you. Don’t stop yourself. 
- Enjoy your work. Stay as light and unburdened as possible. Taking yourself too seriously starts to close you up. The results of your work don’t have much to do with you. You can only be in charge of producing the work yourself. 
- The essential ingredients for creativity remain exactly the same for everyone: courage, enchantment, permission, persistence, and trust. 
- The art comes from a creative imagination which is working hard and having fun.
- I have many interests, but only a few that are deep enough to power novels. These deep interests (I won’t quite call them obsessions) include how difficult it is—perhaps impossible!—to close Pandora’s technobox once it’s open. 
- the question of why, if there is a God, such terrible things happen
- the thin line between reality and fantasy
- the terrible attraction violence sometimes has for fundamentally good people (The Shining, The Dark Half).
- I’ve also written again and again about the fundamental differences between children and adults, and about the healing power of the human imagination. 
- Writing did not save my life—Dr. David Brown’s skill and my wife’s loving care did that—but it has continued to do what it always has done: it makes my life a brighter and more pleasant place.


## Paying attention.
- Listening. Being present. Paying attention to people, things.


## Getting started is everything.
- Take the first practical step.
- You don’t have to know exactly where it is you’re going. You’ll figure that out much better if you get started than if you try to plan it all out. 
- You won’t always know what you’re doing or where you’re going until you get started. 
- Getting something down on paper makes the thing clearer than just thinking about it. It also gives people something to respond to. 
- Once you start, and have physically begun the process, you have something to work from. Your subconscious can work wonders when you have time to mull over what you’ve begun. It provides surprising flashes of inspiration when you’re engaged in other activities.
- Any motion whatsoever beats inertia, because inspiration will always be drawn to motion.
- Establish a goal, define the challenge, and brain dump all of my first notion for a solution. 
- Now kick back and procrastinate. Every part of your life influences how you look at problem solving. Input expands and contracts your mind; sensory changes such as time of day, level of stress, distractions and mood affect your creative thinking positively and negatively. If stuck in a project, take a break, walk outside, talk to a friend — every situation is affecting the project’s outcome, even without you knowing it. 
- Keep a pen handy. Inspiration will smile. When you see the idea again, your mind will be in a new location and pick up where it left off or tell you to start over. This process of idea construction brings together strong creative solutions that hold up over time.
- Give yourself a deadline and stick to it no matter what — that’s the secret ingredient. 
- The scariest moment is always just before you start. After that, things can only get better.

## Immerse yourself.
- Seek inspiration, all the time.
- Inspiration comes from other people, research.
- Let these things breathe new life into your thinking and imagination.
- When you’re inspired, ideas living within us will find a way to be expressed
- Binge. Feed your mind with information, ideas and inspiration related to your subject. Fill your brain. Get it so full of information. Go off on tangents. Follow your interests. And when your head is full, stop. 

## Create space.
- Sit quietly. Listen. Be present. Reduce multitasking because that wears down the brain. Depends on when you’re doing your creative work. Find the time of day that works best for you.
- Traveler’s mindset
- Have a place where you go to be refreshed and receptive. Anything that prepares your mind, body, and spirit for the artistic and creative challenges to come. This is a place you go on a regular basis to enjoy or indulge yourself, let go of worries, where nothing is planned, ideas surface on their own, and you reap the benefits of the frequent time outs you take.
- A place where you can go and just get lost. Lose track of time and space and self.  
- Turn off distractions. You need time and space to do the work. 
- You’re likely consumed by your own dramas, anxieties, distractions, insecurities and duties that you aren’t receptive to inspiration. You might miss the signal because you’re watching TV, or shopping, or brooding over how angry you are at somebody, or pondering your failures and mistakes, or generally just really busy.
- There will come a day when you’re open and relaxed enough to actually receive something. 
- Simple understanding that whatever is bad for you is probably bad for your work. 
- It starts with this: put your desk in the corner, and every time you sit down there to write, remind yourself why it isn’t in the middle of the room. Life isn’t a support-system for art. It’s the other way around.(stephen king)
- The biggest aid to regular (Trollopian?) production is working in a serene atmosphere. It’s difficult for even the most naturally productive writer to work in an environment where alarms and excursions are the rule rather than the exception.
- The combination of a healthy body and a stable relationship with a self-reliant woman who takes zero shit from me or anyone else has made the continuity of my working life possible.
- The space can be humble (probably should be, as I think I have already suggested), and it really needs only one thing: a door which you are willing to shut. The closed door is your way of telling the world and yourself that you mean business; you have made a serious commitment to write and intend to walk the walk as well as talk the talk.
- By the time you step into your new writing space and close the door, you should have settled on a daily writing goal. As with physical exercise, it would be best to set this goal low at first, to avoid discouragement. I suggest a thousand words a day, and because I’m feeling magnanimous, I’ll also suggest that you can take one day a week off, at least to begin with. No more; you’ll lose the urgency and immediacy of your story if you do. With that goal set, resolve to yourself that the door stays closed until that goal is met.
- Whether it’s a vignette of a single page or an epic trilogy like The Lord of the Rings, the work is always accomplished one word at a time. The door closes the rest of the world out; it also serves to close you in and keep you focused on the job at hand.
- it’s wise to eliminate every possible distraction.


## Show the fuck up.
- It’s a simple and generous rule of life that whatever you practice, you’ll improve at. Just stay with the process and don’t panic. We’re meant to engage with inspiration, and inspiration wants to work with us. 
- Keep it about the work. Focus on the work itself. Make that the thing. Not how successful you are or if your profile looks good, or whatever else. Focus on what interests you and make it about that. 
- Practice the art, always reminding yourself that your job is to say what you see, and then to get on with your story.
- Keep showing up. Even when you’re not feeling it. 
- If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot. This sort of stylistic blending is a necessary part of developing one’s own style, but it doesn’t occur in a vacuum. You have to read widely, constantly refining (and redefining) your own work as you do so. Reading is the creative center of a writer’s life. I take a book with me everywhere I go, and find there are all sorts of opportunities to dip in. Reading takes time, and the glass teat takes too much of it.
- The sort of strenuous reading and writing program I advocate—four to six hours a day, every day—will not seem strenuous if you really enjoy doing these things and have an aptitude for them; in fact, you may be following such a program already.
- If “read a lot, write a lot” is the Great Commandment—and I assure you that it is—how much writing constitutes a lot?
- he wrote for two and a half hours each morning before leaving for work. This schedule was ironclad. If he was in mid-sentence when the two and a half hours expired, he left that sentence unfinished until the next morning. And if he happened to finish one of his six-hundred-page heavyweights with fifteen minutes of the session remaining, he wrote The End, set the manuscript aside, and began work on the next book.
- My own schedule is pretty clear-cut. Mornings belong to whatever is new—the current composition. Afternoons are for naps and letters. Evenings are for reading, family, Red Sox games on TV, and any revisions that just cannot wait. Basically, mornings are my prime writing time.
- Once I start work on a project, I don’t stop and I don’t slow down unless I absolutely have to. If I don’t write every day, the characters begin to stale off in my mind
- Still, I believe the first draft of a book—even a long one—should take no more than three months, the length of a season. I like to get ten pages a day, which amounts to 2,000 words. That’s 180,000 words over a three-month span, a goodish length for a book—something in which the reader can get happily lost, if the tale is done well and stays fresh.
- If you’re a beginner, though, let me urge that you take your story through at least two drafts; the one you do with the study door closed and the one you do with it open.
- With the door shut, downloading what’s in my head directly to the page, I write as fast as I can and still remain comfortable.
- If I write rapidly, putting down my story exactly as it comes into my mind, only looking back to check the names of my characters and the relevant parts of their back stories, I find that I can keep up with my original enthusiasm and at the same time outrun the self-doubt that’s always waiting to settle in.
- This first draft—the All-Story Draft—should be written with no help (or interference) from anyone else.
- There’ll be time to show off what you’ve done when you finish  . . . . but even after finishing I think you must be cautious and give yourself a chance to think while the story is still like a field of freshly fallen snow, absent of any tracks save your own.
- The great thing about writing with the door shut is that you find yourself forced to concentrate on story to the exclusion of practically everything else.
- getting that first draft down on paper while the shape of the fossil is still bright and clear in your mind.
- Like the Zen approach to archery or anything else, you identify the goal and then forget about it and concentrate on the process.

## Creativity is a muse. Treat it like one.
- Give your creativity a name or something. Make it be a muse if that makes you feel less pressure. You’re trying to make yourself as receptive and open to the muse as possible. Keeping your mind engaged. If you’re in service to this other being this other entity, rather than responsible to yourself, I find it eases the pressure. This outside force wants to work through you, you just need to let it. It’s not about you failing to live up to your own god damn potential. 
- It’s a subtle but important distinction between being a genius, and having a genius. When artists are burdened with the label of “genius” they run the risk of losing the ability to take themselves lightly, or to create freely. Rather than being a genius, the Greeks and Romans both believed in the idea of an external daemon of creativity, a sort of house elf you lived within the walls of your home and aided you in your efforts. The Romans didn’t believe an exceptionally gifted person was a genius, they believed they had a genius.
- Take you out of yourself. 
- ^^ I am so obsessed with the above and I’ve heard others describe it as such
- Present yourself well. Get dressed to do the work. 
- The work wants to be made, and it wants to be made through you.
- good story ideas seem to come quite literally from nowhere, sailing at you right out of the empty sky: two previously unrelated ideas come together and make something new under the sun. Your job isn’t to find these ideas but to recognize them when they show up.
- These alien creatures got into your head and just started  . . . . well, tommyknocking around in there. What you got was energy and a kind of superficial intelligence (the writer, Bobbi Anderson, creates a telepathic typewriter and an atomic hot-water heater, among other things). What you gave up in exchange was your soul. It was the best metaphor for drugs and alcohol my tired, overstressed mind could come up with.
- At its most basic we are only discussing a learned skill, but do we not agree that sometimes the most basic skills can create things far beyond our expectations? We are talking about tools and carpentry, about words and style  . . . . but as we move along, you’d do well to remember that we are also talking about magic.
- There is a muse, but he’s not going to come fluttering down into your writing room and scatter creative fairy-dust all over your typewriter or computer station. He lives in the ground. He’s a basement guy. You have to descend to his level, and once you get down there you have to furnish an apartment for him to live in. You have to do all the grunt labor, in other words, while the muse sits and smokes cigars and admires his bowling trophies and pretends to ignore you. Do you think this is fair? I think it’s fair. He may not be much to look at, that muse-guy, and he may not be much of a conversationalist (what I get out of mine is mostly surly grunts, unless he’s on duty), but he’s got the inspiration. It’s right that you should do all the work and burn all the midnight oil, because the guy with the cigar and the little wings has got a bag of magic. There’s stuff in there that can change your life.
- Personal note: Playing the role of a paleontologist or archaeologist or a sculptor. Have seen those metaphors get thrown out a lot by both Gilbert and King. 
- I want you to understand that my basic belief about the making of stories is that they pretty much make themselves.
- I believed stories are found things, like fossils…
- Stories are relics, part of an undiscovered pre-existing world. The writer’s job is to use the tools in his or her toolbox to get as much of each one out of the ground intact as possible. Sometimes the fossil you uncover is small; a seashell. Sometimes it’s enormous, a Tyrannosaurus Rex with all those gigantic ribs and grinning teeth.
- No matter how good you are, no matter how much experience you have, it’s probably impossible to get the entire fossil out of the ground without a few breaks and losses. To get even most of it, the shovel must give way to more…
- Plot is a far bigger tool, the writer’s jackhammer. You can liberate a fossil from hard ground with a jackhammer, no argument there, but you know as well as I do that the jackhammer is going to break almost as much stuff as it liberates. It’s clumsy, mechanical, anticreative. Plot is, I think, the good writer’s last resort and the dullard’…
- A strong enough situation renders the whole question of plot moot, which is fine with me. The most interesting situations can usually be expressed as a What-if question:
	- What if vampires invaded a small New England village? (‘Salem’s Lot)
	- What if a policeman in a remote Nevada town went berserk and started killing everyone in sight? (Desperation)
	- What if a cleaning woman suspected of a murder she got away with (her husband) fell under suspicion for a murder she did not commit (her employer)?
	- What if a young mother and her son became trapped in their stalled car by a rabid dog?
	- These were all situations which occurred to me—while showering, while driving, while taking my daily walk—and which I eventually turned into books.
- I think that, when you read your manuscript over (and when you talk it over), you’ll see if symbolism, or the potential for it, exists. If it doesn’t, leave well enough alone. If it does, however—if it’s clearly a part of the fossil you’re working to unearth—go for it.
- Personal note: This idea that I’m just the person uncovering things that already exist (a paleontologist uncovering fossils), than someone coming up with entirely new ideas out of thin air. 
- People are not geniuses. They have geniuses, which is this entirely separate kind of creature or entity that lives within the walls of your home and aids you in your efforts.
- Personal note: you can still set boundaries and guidelines. Like, this is what we think the shape thing is, and here are the qualities we really care about. But keeping the shape large early on, and whittling it down from there, like you’re excavating a dinosaur of creating a sculpture, and being careful to not be overly prescriptive too early in the process. 
- Personal note: It’s not bringing something to life, it’s unearthing it. 
- I read this elsewhere and it’s relevant here, need to find the original quote: It’s a sculptor who knows there is something hidden within the marble, it’s her job to find it and excavate it. 
- Personal note: You’re just uncovering stuff that’s already there. That takes the pressure off it. You just have to be open and paying attention. 


## Take care of yourself.
- Simple understanding that whatever is bad for you is probably bad for your work. 

## Take a fucking break.
- When your head is full, stop. Take a break. Fuck around. Don’t do anything related to your project, because this is when the really hardworking part of your brain goes into high gear. Go for a walk or a run. These low cognitive load activities are pretty amazing at creating the space you need for your brain to make connections. Relax, live, absorb.
- Step away to gain a new perspective. 
- Make a list of things that interest or inspire you — seeing movies, visiting museums and art galleries, getting back to nature by going to far hike or gardening, traveling whenever or wherever you can, and reading at every opportunity. Doing unfamiliar things puts you in a learning mode that refills the web quickly.
- If you write a novel, spend weeks and then months catching it word by word, you owe it both to the book and to yourself to lean back (or take a long walk) when you’ve finished and ask yourself why you bothered—why you spent all that time, why it seemed so important. In other words, what’s it all about, Alfie?
- You’ve done a lot of work and you need a period of time (how much or how little depends on the individual writer) to rest. Your mind and imagination—two things which are related, but not really the same—have to recycle themselves, at least in regard to this one particular work. My advice is that you take a couple of days off—go fishing, go kayaking, do a jigsaw puzzle—and then go to work on something else. Something shorter, preferably, and something that’s a complete change of direction and pace from your newly finished book.
- How long you let your book rest—sort of like bread dough between kneadings—is entirely up to you, but I think it should be a minimum of six weeks. During this time your manuscript will be safely shut away in a desk drawer, aging and (one hopes) mellowing.
- You’re not, though, and you’re not ready to go back to the old project until you’ve gotten so involved in a new one (or re-involved in your day-to-day life) that you’ve almost forgotten the unreal estate that took up three hours of your every morning or afternoon for a period of three or five or seven months.
- When you come to the correct evening (which you well may have marked on your office calendar), take your manuscript out of the drawer. If it looks like an alien relic bought at a junk-shop or yard sale where you can hardly remember stopping, you’re ready.


## Share your work.
- Share your stuff and show your work to people around you.
- Making things, sharing those things with an open heart and no expectations.
- Also, needy or not, you might want to watch and see when your I.R. puts your manuscript down to do something else. What scene was he or she reading? What was so easy to put down?
- You need to listen very carefully to the things I.R. didn’t understand, and then ask yourself if you understand them. If you do and just didn’t put those parts across, your job on the second draft is to clarify. If you don’t—if the parts of the back story your Ideal Reader queried are hazy to you, as well—then you need to think a lot more carefully about the past events that cast a light on your characters’ present behavior.
- In the very same essay, he mentions the importance of having a close friend to have real and substantive conversations with.

## Refine.
- For me the answer has always been two drafts and a polish 
- Sit down with your door shut (you’ll be opening it to the world soon enough), a pencil in your hand, and a legal pad by your side. Then read your manuscript over.
- Do it all in one sitting, if that’s possible (it won’t be, of course, if your book is a four- or five-hundred-pager).
- Make all the notes you want, but concentrate on the mundane housekeeping jobs, like fixing misspellings and picking up inconsistencies.
- With six weeks’ worth of recuperation time, you’ll also be able to see any glaring holes in the plot or character development. I’m talking about holes big enough to drive a truck through. It’s amazing how some of these things can elude the writer while he or she is occupied with the daily work of composition. And listen—if you spot a few of these big holes, you are forbidden to feel depressed about them or to beat up on yourself.

## Capture ideas.
- Keep one or multiple types of writing instruments to capture ideas and impulses. Ideas can be fleeting. I have a little notebook, but I also jot things down in my Things apps and file them away in the Someday tab. Organization isn’t super important, the main thing is to get the ideas down.

## Hone your process.
- Building a routine.
- Your schedule—in at about the same time every day, out when your thousand words are on paper or disk—exists in order to habituate yourself, to make yourself ready to dream just as you make yourself ready to sleep by going to bed at roughly the same time each night and following the same ritual as you go.
- In both writing and sleeping, we learn to be physically still at the same time we are encouraging our minds to unlock from the humdrum rational thinking of our daytime lives.
- Your job is to make sure the muse knows where you’re going to be every day from nine ‘til noon or seven ‘til three. If he does know, I assure you that sooner or later he’ll start showing up, chomping his cigar and making his magic.



## Curation as a creative act.

## Ignore everything.

## Scratchpad.
- Really all boils down to inspiration, stimulation, learning, curiosity. 
- Understand the problem, do the research, play hard looking for potential options, sleep on it, and let your subconscious do the rest.
- It’s a virtuous cycle. The more you practice, learn, and make discoveries, the more confident you’ll be. 
- Richer, more textured. More varied. 
- State of uninterrupted marvel 
- I knew, not because Owen stopped practicing, but because he was practicing only during the periods Mr. Bowie had set for him: half an hour after school four days a week, plus an hour on the weekends. Owen mastered the scales and the notes—nothing wrong with his memory, his lungs, or his eye-hand coordination—but we never heard him taking off, surprising himself with something new, blissing himself out. And as soon as his practice time was over, it was back into the case with the horn, and there it stayed until the next lesson or practice-time.
- What this suggested to me was that when it came to the sax and my son, there was never going to be any real play-time; it was all going to be rehearsal. That’s no good. If there’s no joy in it, it’s just no good. It’s best to go on to some other area, where the deposits of talent may be richer and the fun quotient higher. Talent renders the whole idea of rehearsal meaningless; when you find something at which you are talented, you do it (whatever it is) until your fingers bleed or your eyes are ready to fall out of your head. Even when no one is listening (or reading, or watching), every outing is a bravura performance, because you as the creator are happy. Perhaps even ecstatic. That goes for reading and writing as well as for playing a musical instrument, hitting a baseball, or running the four-forty.
